# Simple_2d_game

This project is a simple game created for learning purposes.

## ðŸ§  Design Patterns Used

- **State Machine Pattern** â€“ used to manage object behavior through well-defined states.
- **Single Point of Entry** â€“ centralized access to game settings and initialization logic.

## ðŸ§° Technologies

- **Unity** â€“ game engine used for development.
- **DOTween** â€“ used for basic animation and tweening functionality.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The project demonstrates how to structure a Unity game using common architectural patterns and how to work with external libraries like DOTween.

## ðŸŽ¥ Video Demo
