# Simple_2d_game

This project is a simple game created for learning purposes.

## 🧠 Design Patterns Used

- **State Machine Pattern** – used to manage object behavior through well-defined states.
- **Single Point of Entry** – centralized access to game settings and initialization logic.

## 🧰 Technologies

- **Unity** – game engine used for development.
- **DOTween** – used for basic animation and tweening functionality.

## 🎯 Purpose

The project demonstrates how to structure a Unity game using common architectural patterns and how to work with external libraries like DOTween.
